# ActiveDB
A PoC log in DB manager that uses query counts and sorting to keep the most relevant users at the top of the DB.

# Concept

The idea behind this was that there are "power" users that may log into an application more than others such as dead accounts, or temperary users. This uses a query count to determine who logs in more and sorts the DB via that. So if a user is logging in or doing many actions at either a particular moment or through an extended period it would be at the top of the records.Â
